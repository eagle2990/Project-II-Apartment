# VR Nanodegree
## Second Project

By Eduardo Alejandro Guzman Lau Len

This project took me around 8 hours to develop. The easiest thing to do was placing the objects, while the hardest was implementing lights, the main problem with it was knowing which values will be good.

According to tests made to the Baked Resolution, I have found that:
1. Setting it to 2: There are shadows, but there is not much detail, almost similar as no baked lights. Some book colors are just black except the red color
2. Setting it to 5: Similar as previous, just more colors (like brown which is derived from red). Some shades are not consistend, giving a weird ambient.
3. Setting it to 40: Objects and shadows feel more soft, they don't seem real, but it's not like the first two, the environment feels more pleasent and the light is more accurate to real life (size 8MB).
4. Setting it to 80: Any weird shadow gets removed, it gives the sensation to be in a high quality environment. (size 16 MB).
5. Setting it to 160: Everything looks perfect. Highest details from all the previous settings (32 MB)
